## About
----------------------------------------
<p> Designed to inspire creativity in the kitchen when your fridge looks bare, the app makes decision making easier when it comes to meal times. By encouraging you to use up the ingredients you have to hand, Fridge Savant helps you to reduce food waste, and so manage your budget better. </p>

----------------------------------------
## Set-up
----------------------------------------
The team made the decision to have a very common client-server type architecture. 
As you are reading information here about the server side of the application, you will also have to run the client side written in React.
You can find the client-side application [here](https://github.com/jasonrowsell/fridge-savant-client).

#### Run
```
$ git clone git@github.com:mikejeuga/fridge-savant-server.git
$ cd fridge-savant-server
$ npm run server
```
Navigate on port:[5000](http://localhost:5000).
